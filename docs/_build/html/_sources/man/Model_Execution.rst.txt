Model Execution
===============

The development, operation, and execution of the tRIBS model has been improved significantly for the release under the MIT license. Despite this, it remains the responsibility of the user to provide the model with the appropriate inputs in the correct format and to understand the various means of running the model. Below we provide information on how to obtain the tRIBS executable and how to run it.

Packaged Software
-----------------

We offer tRIBS executables for both MacOS (compatible with Intel or Silicon chips) and Ubuntu. For MacOS, the Intel chip version was built on macOS 13 (Ventura), while the Silicon chip was built on  macOS 14 (Sonoma). The Ubuntu binary was created using version 22.04. If you plan to run the model in parallel using these binaries, it's advisable to have the latest version (5.0.3) of `OpenMPI <https://open-mpi.org/>`_ installed and upgraded. See the :doc:`Executables` page for more details. If these compiled versions are not compatible with your system we also provide a Docker image detailed in the :doc:`Docker` section. And lastly, building tRIBS is a relative simple process as outlined below.

Compilation Instructions
-------------------------------

tRIBS is written in C++ and must be compiled before use. You can obtain the source code from the tRIBS `GitHub repository <https://github.com/tribshms/tRIBS>`_. To facilitate cross-platform compilation and increase the ease of compiling tRIBS in either *parallel* or *serial* mode, we employ the CMake build system. If you intend to use tRIBS in *parallel* then you will need to install a Message Passing Interface (MPI), the current version has been tested to compile correctly with `OpenMPI <https://open-mpi.org/>`_ though other MPI software may work. Instructions for compiling tRIBS on your machine using CMake are outlined below. Additionally, we maintain a Docker image that contains both the serial and parallel version of tRIBS as documented `here`_. Note: these instructions are for using CMake via terminal; additional documentation_ is available for using the CMake GUI.

CMake
~~~~~

1. Use `Homebrew`_ for macOS or similar package manager for Linux to install CMake. Alternatively, you can download CMake_ directly, but a package manager is preferred as it will catch additional dependencies.

    .. _Homebrew: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmake
    .. _CMake: https://cmake.org/download/

2. You can check to see if CMake is on your path by typing `cmake` into the command line. If it says it's not found, then you will need to set cmake to your path. For example, if you downloaded CMake and it's now in your application folder, you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install

3. Next, change directory to the tRIBS source code. It should look something like this but is dependent on where the tRIBS source code is located:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/Documents/tRIBS

4. Once in the directory containing the src code subdirectory and CMakeLists.txt, execute the following code in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build --target all

The first command tells CMake to generate the make files for tRIBS in a folder called build, followed by the second line which effectively compiles the code. If you would like to compile the parallel version of tRIBS the you can pass the flag ``-Dparallel=ON`` as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -S . -B build -Dparallel=ON
    cmake --build build --target all

Note you can pass other flags including the optimization level.

5. After, you can check to see that the executable was made by using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ls build/

The executable will have a name specified by the CMakeLists.txt file. Currently, for the serial version the executable name is tRIBS and tRIBSpar for the parallel version.

Run Instructions
----------------------

In order to run the tRIBS Model, an Input File is required. This file can have any name, but by convention the extension ``*.in`` is used. The model can be run from the UNIX command line by using the following syntax (within the same directory as the ``tribs`` executable):

    ::

              % tribs inputfile.in [options]

For running the model in parallel mode, mpirun (or a suitable alternative MPI command) is needed:
    ::

              % mpirun [options] ./tRIBS inputfile.in [options]

Alternatively, the model can be run from a separate directory by specifying the pathnames of the executable and the Input File. **Table 5.1** presents a list of the options with descriptions and default values.

      +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
      |  Run Option    |   Description                                         |  Default Setting  |
      +================+=======================================================+===================+
      |    *-A*        |   Automatic listing of rainfall fields                |  (default = off)  |
      +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
      |    *-F*        |   Measured and forecasted rain                        |  (default = off)  |
      +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
      |    *-V*        |   [NodeID] Verbose mode (output run-time info)        |  (default = off)  |
      +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
      |    *-O*        |   On after simulation completion, awaiting user input |  (default = off)  |
      +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
      |    *-K*        |   Check input file for consistency                    |  (default = on)   |
      +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+

The most important of these options for the new user to be acquainted with are *-V* (verbose screen output), *-O* (continuously on model state). The last of these should be used only if one wishes to keep the model in memory while changing the inputs specified in the Input File (all model inputs except the TIN Mesh can be altered).
